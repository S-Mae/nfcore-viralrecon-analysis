# Workflow Documentation

This folder contains all configuration files, commands, and inputs used to reproduce the **nf-core/viralrecon** pipeline run for SARS-CoV-2 analysis.

## Purpose

The goal of this folder is to ensure full reproducibility of the computational workflow.  
It allows anyoneto recreate the exact analysis environment and pipeline setup.

## Notes

- The environment file (`MOOC.yml`) was originally created as part of the **Wellcome Connecting Science Course: Bioinformatics for Biologists**, then modified for independent analysis.  
- All commands here were tested on **Ubuntu (via WSL2)** using **Nextflow + Singularity**.
